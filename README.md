## Code Explanation

*   **`index.html`:** This file provides the structure and content of the website. It includes the header, navigation, sections for "About Me," "Skills," "Projects," and "Contact," and a footer.
*   **`style.css`:** This file contains the CSS styles that define the visual appearance of the website. It includes styles for the layout, typography, colors, and responsiveness.  The background image is also specified here.
*   **`script.js`:** This file contains the JavaScript code. Currently it contains smooth scrolling functionality but can be expanded to include other client-side features as needed.
*   **`background.jpg`:** This is the background image used for the website.  **Note:**  Since a direct download link was not provided, a placeholder value `background.jpg` is used. You should replace this with the actual image and ensure it is located in the same directory as `index.html` or update the CSS path accordingly.
